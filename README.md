# brainfuck_interpreter
A small brainfuck interpreter with some personal modifications as well as some basis exceptionhandling.

The interpreter features the possibility of either outputting data interpreted as ASCII code or as integers.

The interpreter can catch syntaxerrors in the form of unclosed or unopened brackets, runtimeerrors such as ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions and ValueErrors when inputting.
